iCount: protein-RNA interaction analysis
========================================

iCount is a Python module and associated command-line interface (CLI), which provides all the
commands needed to process protein-RNA `iCLIP`_ interaction data and to identify and quantify
sites of protein-RNA interactions on RNA.

iCount's main input are FASTQ files with `iCLIP`_ sequencing data, its main output are BED files
with identified and quantified cross-linked sites.

A number of analyses are included in iCount that provide insights into the properties of
protein-RNA interaction.

segment
=======

usage: iCount segment [-h] [-prog] [-S] [-F] [-P] [-M]
                      annotation segmentation fai

Parse annotation file into internal iCount structure - segmentation.

Currently, only annotations from ENSEMBl and GENCODE are supported.
http://www.gencodegenes.org/
http://www.ensembl.org

Segmentation is used in almost all further analyses.

In segmentation, each transcript is partitioned into so called
regions/intervals. Such regions must span the whole transcript, but should not
intersect with each other. However, higher hierarchy levels: transcripts and
genes can of course intersect each other.

Example of possible segmentation::

    Genome level: |---------------------------------------------------|

    Gene level:    |--------------gene1--------------|   |-intergenic-|
                                 |---------gene2--------|

    Transcript l.: |----------transcript1---------|
                           |-------transcript2-------|
                                 |------transcript3-----|

    Region level:  |-CDS-||-intron-||-CDS-||-UTR3-|

For simplicity, only the partition of transcript1 is presented.

positional arguments:

xlsites
=======

usage: iCount xlsites [-h] [-g] [--quant] [--segmentation] [-mis] [--mapq_th]
                      [--multimax] [--gap_th] [-prog] [-S] [-F] [-P] [-M]
                      bam sites_unique sites_multi skipped

Quantity cross-link events and determine their positions.

The simplest version of this script would oprate on such example::

    |--a---b--- reference sequence, chr 14, positive strand ------------
        |rbc1---R1--------|
        |rbc1---R2------|
        |rbc2---R3------|
            |rbc1--------R4-------------|
            |rbc3------R5-----|

Five reads (R1-R5) are mapped to a reference sequence (chromosome 14, positive
strand). Reads start on two distinct positons. On first position, there is
R1-R3. Cross-link site is located one nucleotide before start of the read (on
negative strand, one nucleotide after end of read). However, we wish to count
number of cDNA molecules, not the number of reads. This can be done by counting
the number of distinct random barcodes (sometimes also called randomers). So in
upper example, we have:

    Postion a: 3 reads, 2 distinct random barcodes = 2 cDNA's
    Postion b: 2 reads, 2 distinct random barcodes = 2 cDNA's

However, things can get complicated when a single read is mapped in multiple
parts. This can happen for several reasons. One common example is that introns
are removed during transcription. This can be illustrated with the following
image::

    |---------------- reference -----------------------

    |--------------------------transcript--------------------------|
    |---UTR5---||---intron---||---exon---||---intron---||---exon---|

                                |-------R1-------|
                                |--R2.1-->              <-R2.2-|
                      |-R3.1->      <-R3.2->            <-R3.3-|
                        |-R4.1->      <-R4.2-|

Read R1 and R2 are starting on same position. For the sake of argument, let's
also pretend they also have same random barcode. In so, we would count them as a
single cDNA molecule (= single cross-link event), even though it is obvious that
they represent two separate cross-link events. In order to fix this, we count
not just the number of different randomers on same position, but also number of
different "second-start" coordinates. Second-start coordinate is just the
coordinate of the second part of the read. This way, the actual number of
cross-link events can be determined more accurately. If read is not split, it's
second-start coordinate is 0. If read has multiple "holes" (as read R3) we
determine second-start from the largest hole.

Reads whose second-start do NOT fall on segmentation (like R4) are stored in a
separate BAM file ``sites_strange``. They should be treated with special care,
since they can indicate not-yet annotated features in genome. If segmentation is
not given, all reads with holes, bigger than ``holesize_th`` are considered
strange.

Another parameter needs more explanation: ``group_by``. When algorithm starts,
reads from BAM file are grouped in hierarchical structure by::

    * chromosome and strand
    * cross-link position
    * random barcode
    * second-start

Each second-start group receives 1 cDNA score. This score is divided to each
read in group (if there are 5 reads in group, each one gets 1/5 score). This
enables that each read has it's cDNA score and of course, 1 "read score". This
scores can be assigned to start (actually, to cross-link position), midlle or
end position of read. By default, score is of course assigned to cross-link
location. But for diagnostic purpuses, scores can also be assigned to middle or
end coordinate of the read.

TODO: check overlap between unique and multimap BED files, should be small,
otherwise, we should think of a more approapriate quantification of (division
of randomers among) unique mapped sites that overlap with multimapped reads

positional arguments:
  bam                   Input BAM file with mapped reads
  sites_unique          Output BED6 file to store data from uniquely mapped reads
  sites_multi           Output BED6 file to store data from multi-mapped reads
  skipped               Output BAM file to store reads that do not map as expected by segmentation and
                        reference genome sequence. If read's second start does not fall on any of
                        segmentation borders, it is considered problematic. If segmentation is not provided,
                        every read in two parts with gap longer than gap_th is not used (skipped).
                        All such reads are reported to the user for further exploration

peaks
=====

usage: iCount peaks [-h] [--scores] [--features  [...]] [-g]
                    [--merge_features] [--half_window] [--fdr] [-p] [-rnd]
                    [-prog] [-S] [-F] [-P] [-M]
                    annotation sites peaks

Find positions with high density of cross-linked sites.

There are two typical variants of this analysis, depending on the parameters:

* Gene-wise analysis, where:
    * features = gene
    * group_by = gene_id

* Transcript-wise analysis where:
    * features = CDS, intron, UTR3, UTR5, ncRNA, intergenic
    * group_by = transcript_id

Let's look at the Gene-wise analysis in more detail first. Imagine the following
situation::

    |-----------gene1----------|
            |-----------------------------gene2------------------------------|
           ab c                d                 e

    a = 60
    b = 100
    c = 70
    d = 40
    e = 100
    gene1: gene_id = 001
    gene2: gene_id = 002

There are two genes (partially intersecting) and five positions with cross-links
(noted with a, b, c, d and e). Crosslink position "a" has 60 cross-link events,
"b" has 100 cross-link events and so on. Also, gene1 has gene_id 001, etc.

The algorithm first finds all intersections between annotation and
cross-links. In this case cross-link position "a" intersects only with gene1,
while position "b" intersects also with gene2... Annotation can include
various other types of segments (transcripts, intergenic, ncRNA, etc.), but only
segments of type ``gene`` are considered for intersection. This behaviour is
controlled by parameter ``features``.

Next step is to make groups of cross-links. They are grouped by ``group_by``
parameter (in this case, it equals to ``gene_id``). There will be 2 groups.
First group name will be 001 and will contain a, b, c and d. Second group name
will be 002 and will contain b, c, d and e.

The question now is: has any of positions in each group significantly increased
number of cross-link events? And how can one quantify this significance?

This is done by parmutation analysis. It draws a number of random situations
with same group size and number of cross-link scores. Number of such draws is
determined by ``perm`` parameter. This way, a random distribution is calculated.
When comparing the observed distribution with the random one, FDR values are
assigned to each position. A cutoff FRD value is chosen and only positions with
FDR < FDR cutoff are considered as significant.

One must also know that when considering only scores on single positions
significant *clusters* of cross-links can be missed. In the upper example, it is
obvious, that something more significantly is happening on position b than on
position e, despite having the same score. To account for this, algorithm
considers not only the score of single cross-link, but also scores of
cross-links some nucleotides before and after. This behaviour in controlled by
half-window (half_window) parameter. In the upper example, score of position b
eqals to 160 if half_window = 1 and 2530 if half_window=2. Score of position e
remains 100.

Let's also look at the transcript-wise analysis. In this case, scenario also
includes transcripts and sub-transcript elements::

    |-----------gene1----------|
    |--------transcript1-------|
    |-ncRNA-||-intron-||-ncRNA-|
            |-----------------------------gene2------------------------------|
            |---------------transcript2--------------|
            |-CDS-||-intron-||-CDS-||-intron-||-UTR3-|
                                    |---------------transcript3--------------|
                                    |-UTR5-||-intron-||-CDS-||-intron-||-CDS-|

           ab c                d                 e

    a = 60
    b = 100
    c = 70
    d = 40
    e = 100
    gene1: gene_id = 001
    gene2: gene_id = 002
    transcript1: transcript_id = 0001
    transcript2: transcript_id = 0002
    transcript3: transcript_id = 0003

Value of parameter features is: CDS, intron, UTR3, UTR5, ncRNA, intergenic.
Value of parameter group_by is transcript_id. Since we have multiple values in
feature parameter, another parameter becomes important: merge_features. If set
to false (default) algorithm will make the following groups:

    * group name: ncRNA-0001, members: a, b, d
    * group name: intron-0001, members: c
    * group name: CDS-0002, members: b, c, d
    * group name: UTR3-0002, members: e
    * group name: intron-0003, members: e

However, if merge_features equals to true, groups are:

    * group name: 0001, members: a, b, c, d
    * group name: 0002, members: b, c, d, e
    * group name: 0003, members: e

Then, for each group, procedure is exactly the same as in Gene-wise case.

rnamaps
=======

usage: iCount rnamaps [-h] [--implicit_handling] [-mis] [--mapq_th]
                      [--holesize_th] [-S] [-F] [-P] [-M]
                      bam segmentation out_file strange cross_transcript

Distribution of cross-links relative to genomic landmarks.

What is an RNA-map?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine the following situation (on positive strand)::

    |---intron1---||---exon2---||---intron2---||---exon3---|
                              x|-----R1-----|

Situation is simple: a read perfectly maps to reference genome. First cross-link
(nucletide before the start of read R1) is located 2 nucleotides before
landmark of type 'exon-intron'. By examining all cross-links(reads) that are
located in vicinity of landmarks one can obtain the distribution of
cross-link-to-landmark distances. Such distibution is called an RNA map.

Of course, situation gets complicated. Real-world-situation more likely looks
like this::

    |--------transcript1-------|
    |-ncRNA-||-intron-||-ncRNA-|
            |------------------transcript2-----------------|
            |--CDS--||-intron-||--CDS--||-intron-||--UTR3--|
                                    |---------------transcript3--------------|
                                    |-UTR5-||-intron-||-CDS-||-intron-||-CDS-|

             x|-----R1-----|
             x|R2.1->          <--R2.2-|
                                x|-R3-|

All sort of situations can arise:

    * read can intersect with multiple genes/transcripts/segments
      simultaneously, which means that one read is relevant for different types
      of RNA maps.
    * if whole read is mapped to one segment (as is read R3 on transcript2),
      then it is impossible to tell the type of RNA map it belongs to: is it
      CDS-intron or intron-CDS?
    * read can be mapped in multiple parts - for example when introns are
      removed before translation, first half of read will map to ``exon1`` and
      second half to ``exon2``.
    * same cross-link event can be represented by multiple reads with same
      random barcode.
    * ...

The algorithm takes care for all of this, as explained below. It outputs a file,
that looks like this::

    rna_map_type    position    all     explicit
    exon-intron     42          13      14
    exon-intron     43          123     19
    exon-intron     44          56      16
    ....
    intron-CDS      23474       34      2
    intron-CDS      23475       85      65
    intron-CDS      23476       92      1
    ...

Each line consits of four columns: RNA map type, position, all and explicit. RNA
map type defines the landmark type, while position defines relative distance of
cross-links to this landmark. All and explicit are counting number of crosslinks
that are ``positions`` away from landmark of type RNA map type. Cross link is
explicit, if read identifying cross-link is mapped to both parts of RNA-map. In
upper example, R1 is explicit, since it maps to intron *and* exon. Read R3 on
transcript2 is implicit, since one has to decide wheather it's cross-link
belongs to ``CDS-intron`` or ``intron-CDS`` RNA map. The term *all* means
explicit + implicit in this context.

If read is implicit (start and stop within same segment), one can choose two
varinats of the algorithm. One option is that whole score of read is given to
RNA-map of the *closest* landmark. Other option is to *split* score on half to
both neighbouring segments. This behaviour is controlled by parameter
implicit_handling.

There are also two cases when a read can map in a way that is not predicted by
annotation:

    * For split reads, second start can fall on nucleotide that is not start of
      a new segment. This behaviour is excactly the same as in xlsites analysis.
      Such reads are reported in file defined with ``strange`` parameter.
    * Reads that map on two different transcripts or even two different genes
      are repoted in file with name defined in cross_transcript.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that still need to be resolved:

    * negative strand inspection:
        * for each ss_group, take annotation from reverse strand and check what
          is the situation on other side.
        * What si again the bio-contxt here - explain in docs...?
    * Test: Each cross-link should have the same cDNA count as in xlsites
      results. The final check should be: sum all scores - the result should be
      the same as for xlsites. Actually, the metrics.cross_transcript should
      also be considered:
      assert: sum(xlsites scores) == sum(RNAmaps "all" + metrics.cross_transc)
    * if read crosses two ore more regions from start to end, only end-type is
      considered for RNAmap type. Should we fix this and which region type to
      take? Since reads are tpyically much shorted than regions, this is
      probably a rare case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wishes and ideas(Jernej, Tomaz):

    * The whole idea is to get a feeling what is happening around landmarks

    * separate pre-mRNA and mRNA [this is partially done in _add_entry]
        * Life cyle of RNA: part of DNA in transcribed to RNA in nucleus. Introns
          are cut out already between this process! Really???
        * pre-mRNA contains introns, mature mRNA has no introns and goes outside
          from the nucleus.
        * so: RNAmap exon-intron will for sure contain only pre-mRNA, but RNAmap
          exon-exon can contain pre-mRNA and mRNA... It would be really nice to
          report on percentage of theese two categories.
        * This can be done by introducing three categories:  pre-mRNa, mRNA and
          undecided. This can be determined from results - they contain explicit /
          implicit info and RNAmap type:

    * Intoduce three categories (colors in visualisation?) in every RNAmap type.
      Let's take exon-intron as example:

        * whole read in left part - color #1 (negative coord, implicit)
        * whole read in right part - color #2 (positive coord, implicit)
        * read crossing junction - color #3 (explicit)

    * How to handle situation when one region in individual's sequence clearly
      differs from reference sequence but it is just some variation?

        * Change the reference sequence? This can be complex... Make a helper
          tool for this?
        * Provide additional data in function - which exceptions /abnormalities
          to ignore?

    * Gaussian smooting of RNAmaps?

    * split read - it can differ also on "first-stop", not juts second-start
        * we could have some sort of quality check when observing the variance
          of first-stop-s. THe major question is: "Do all reads for certain
          xlink event indicate the same behaviour?"
