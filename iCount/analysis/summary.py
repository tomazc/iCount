    """
    Make summary report from cross-link and annotation data.

    In the context of this report "type" equals to the combination of 3rd
    column and attribute `subtype` from annotation file (GTF).
    "Regions" are parts of transcript (UTR, CDS, introns...) that "non-
    intersectingly" span the whole transcript. Intergenic regions are also
    considered as region. Each region has one and only one type.

    For each of such types, number of cross-link events/sites is counted.
    Sites = sum of *all* cross-link sites that are in regions of some type.
    Events = sum of col5 for *all* cross-link sites that are in regions of
    some type (multiple events can happen on each cross link). Col5 is
    numerical value in 5th column of cross-link file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    annotation : str
        Path to annotation GTF file (should include subtype attribute).
    sites : str
        Path to BED6 file listing cross-linked sites.
    summary : str
        Path to output tab-delimited file with summary statistics.
    fai : str
        Path to file with chromosome lengths.
    types_length_file : str
        Path to file with lengths of each type.
    digits : int
        Number of decimal places in results.
    subtype : str
        Name of attribute to be used as subtype.
    excluded_types : list_str
        Types listed in 3rd column of GTF to be exclude from analysis.

    Returns
    -------
