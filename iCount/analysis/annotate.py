def annotate_cross_links(annotation, sites, sites_annotated, subtype='biotype', excluded_types=None):
    """
    Annotate each cross-link site with all region types that intersect it.

    Each cross link can overlap/intersect with many intervals in annotation
    file. Each of these intervals has a given type. Make a copy of cross
    link file and include all these types in 4th column.

    In the context of this report "type" equals to the combination of 3rd column
    and attribute `subtype` from annotation file (GTF). Regions/intervals are
    parts of transcript (UTR, CDS, introns...) that "non- intersectingly" span
    the whole transcript. However, since transcripts can overlap, also intervals
    belonging to different transcripts can overlap. Intergenic regions are also
    considered as region. Each region has one and only one type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    annotation : str
        Path to annotation file (should be GTF and include `subtype` attribute).
    sites : str
        Path to input BED6 file listing all cross-linked sites.
    sites_annotated : str
        Path to output BED6 file listing annotated cross-linked sites.
    subtype : str
        Subtype.
    excluded_types : list_str
        Excluded types.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Path to summary report file (should be equal to out_file parameter)
