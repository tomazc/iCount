iCount: protein-RNA interaction analysis
========================================

iCount is a Python module and associated command-line interface (CLI), which provides all the
commands needed to process protein-RNA `iCLIP`_ interaction data and to identify and quantify
sites of protein-RNA interactions on RNA.

iCount's main input are FASTQ files with `iCLIP`_ sequencing data, its main output are BED files
with identified and quantified cross-linked sites.

A number of analyses are included in iCount that provide insights into the properties of
protein-RNA interaction.

Identify and quantify cross-linked sites
----------------------------------------

Transforms information in BAM file on mapped reads and their randomers into BED file.

Reads information on mapped reads and their associated randomer sequence
to produce BED file with cross-link sites.

Reads are first grouped by the start position. Multiple reads that start on
same position and have the same (similar) randomer are collapsed into one (
most common, if many of same frequency, take longest) read.

Collapsed reads can then be grouped in three different ways: by the start,
middle or end position.

When grouping by the start, we report one positions before read start. That
is the most likely cross-linked site.

Grouping by middle and end positions can be used for diagnostic purposes.

TODO: check overlap between unique and multimap BED files, should be small,
otherwise, we should think of a more approapriate quantification of (division
of randomers among) unique mapped sites that overlap with multimapped reads
