"""
Identify and quantify cross-linked sites
----------------------------------------

Transforms information in BAM file on mapped reads and their randomers into BED file.


Reads information on mapped reads and their associated randomer sequence
to produce BED file with cross-link sites.

Reads are first grouped by the start position. Multiple reads that start on
same position and have the same (similar) randomer are collapsed into one (
most common, if many of same frequency, take longest) read.

Collapsed reads can then be grouped in three different ways: by the start,
middle or end position.

When grouping by the start, we report one positions before read start. That
is the most likely cross-linked site.

Grouping by middle and end positions can be used for diagnostic purposes.


TODO: check overlap between unique and multimap BED files, should be small,
otherwise, we should think of a more approapriate quantification of (division
of randomers among) unique mapped sites that overlap with multimapped reads

    Counting the number of reads is easy - just count the number of hits per
    cross-link site.

    Counting the number of cDNAs is also easy - just count the number of
    different barcodes. However, following scenarions also need to be handled:

        * one read ban be mapped to multiple sites. In this case, the
          "contribution" of such read has to be divided equally to all positions
          that it maps to.
        * Also, longer reads should have proportionally greater "contribution".
          than the short ones.

    Upper two scenarions imply that each read contributes::

        weight = 1 * 1/a * b/c
        # a = number of hits
        # b = read length
        # c = sum(read lengths per same barcode)

    Another factor to take into account is also the possibility that a group of
    reads with equal start position and barcode represents multiple cross-links.
    Imagine a read starting 10 bp before exon-intron junction. One group of
    reads maps in the intron section and other reads skip the intron and map on
    next exon with the second part of the read. This can be solved by grouping
    by "second_start", which is the coordinate of the first nucleotide of the
    second part of the read. Each group with unique second start is treated as
    an independent cross-link event. This is done in function
    ``_separate_by_second_starts``

    Returns an object ``counts``::

        counts = {
            position: [cDNA_count, reads_count],
            123: [3.14, 42],
